# TODO

## Theory

* analyze false positives
	* how many have zero false-positive descendants?
	* can we store a set of the most tricky ones?
* exhaustive search for worst case?

* number of reachable intermediate states on reversal problem
  at a given level

* DONE try k!=1


## Implementation

* Show timeline of forward/backward solution
* Do forward/backward solution independently.
* Track start-to-current moves. only search for and notify of backwards solution
  when no such track exists.

* switch to tailwind?

## Report

* Plot like in "Checkers is Solved" for state space size
* Section about reverse solving
* section about GF4

## Future Work

* Reachable state space in reversible Peg Solitaire?
