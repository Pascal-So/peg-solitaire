# Peg Solitaire Frontend

Frontend for the game and the solver, written in [yew](https://docs.rs/yew), complies to WASM.

For running the frontend locally, as well as building it, you'll need the [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) tool.

```bash
# Run the local development server on port 8080
just dev

# Build the frontend to ./dist
just build-frontend
```
