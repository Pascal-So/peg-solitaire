              ). The task of solving the game, determining the final result in a game with no mistakes made by either player, is daunting. Since 1989, almost continuously, dozens of computers have been working on solving checkers, applying state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to the proving process. This paper announces that checkers is now solved: Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw. This is the most challenging popular game to be solved to date, roughly one million times as complex as Connect Four. Artificial intelligence technology has been used to generate strong heuristic-based game-playing programs, such as Deep Blue for chess. Solving a game takes this to the next level by replacing the heuristics with perfection.},

Then we survey results about the complexity of determining ideal play in these games, and the related problems of solving puzzles, in terms of both polynomial-time algorithms and computational intractability results. Our review of background and survey of algorithmic results are by no means complete, but should serve as a useful primer.},

	abstract = {Peg Solitaire is a well known puzzle, which can prove diﬃcult despite its simple rules. Pegs are arranged on a board such that at least one ‘hole’ remains. By making draughts/checkers-like moves, pegs are gradually removed until no further moves are possible or some goal conﬁguration is achieved. This paper considers the English variant, consisting of a board in a cross shape with 33 holes. Modelling Peg Solitaire via constraint or integer programming techniques presents a considerable challenge and is examined in detail. The merits of the resulting models are discussed and they are compared empirically. The sequential nature of the puzzle naturally conforms to a planning problem, hence we also present an experimental comparison with several leading AI planning systems. Other variants of the puzzle, such as ‘Fool’s Solitaire’ and ‘Long-hop’ Solitaire are also considered.},

	abstract = {The game of peg solitaire on graphs was introduced by Beeler and Hoilman in 2011. In this game, pegs are initially placed on all but one vertex of a graph G. If xyz forms a path in G and there are pegs on vertices x and y but not z, then a jump places a peg on z and removes the pegs from x and y. A graph is called solvable if, for some configuration of pegs occupying all but one vertex, some sequence of jumps leaves a single peg. We study the game of reversible peg solitaire, where there are again initially pegs on all but one vertex, but now both jumps and unjumps (the reversal of a jump) are allowed. We show that in this game all non-star graphs that contain a vertex of degree at least three are solvable, that cycles and paths on n vertices, where n is divisible by 2 or 3, are solvable, and that all other graphs are not solvable. We also classify the possible starting hole and ending peg positions for solvable graphs.},

Valid inequalities over this cone, known as pagoda functions, were used to show the infeasibility of various peg games. The link with the well studied dual metric cone and the similarities between their combinatorial structures - see (3) - leads to the study of a dual cut cone analogue; that is, the cone generated by the \{0, 1\}-valued facets of the solitaire cone. This cone is called binary solitaire cone and denoted BSB. We give some results and conjectures on the combinatorial and geometric properties of the binary solitaire cone. In particular we prove that the extreme rays of SB are extreme rays of BSB strengthening the analogy with the dual metric cone whose extreme rays are extreme rays of the dual cut cone. Other related cones are also considered.},
